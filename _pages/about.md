<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now an assistant professor at the School of Software Technology at Zhejiang University. Before that, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the Penn State University working under Prof. [Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/). 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University in 2022, supervised by Prof. [Shouling Ji](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/crew/jsl.html). During Ph.D., I have spent wonderful times in collaborating with academics at the university (e.g., Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/) at UIUC, and Prof. [Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/) at PSU), and researchers in the industrial community (e.g., Dr. [Tao Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ao3wEckAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at Baidu USA (now Ant Financial), Dr. [Jie Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GQJDlW8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at Huawei Singapore Research Center). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree in the Communication Engineering at the College of Information Science and Techonology, Xiamen University.

My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning, emphasizing robustness, privacy, and their interconnections. I have published 20+ papers at the top international conferences and journals such as USENIX Security, CCS, NDSS, ICLR, NeurIPS, ACL, ICCV, etc. 


*<span style="color:red">Openings:</span> I am looking for motivated Master/intern students to join my research group. Please drop me an email if you are interested in working with me!*
